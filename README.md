# GPS-IMU-Integration
An exploration into various GPS/IMU integration techniques conducted as part of undergraduate thesis. Various algorithms are included and tested using simulated IMU/GPS data. MATLAB Navigation Toolbox is required to run code. 

Included Algorithms:
- IMU Only Positioning
- IMU Only Poesitioning with Periodic GPS Reset
- IMU/GPS Extended Kalman Filter
- IMU/GPS Unscented Kalman Filter
- IMU/GPS Extended Kalman Filter with Bias Estimation

Also included is a method for determining IMU random walk and bias instability using Allan Deviation method.
